                        fragrance's longevity.

                        normally lasts for 2 to 4 hours. Because of the lower perfume oil concentration, EDT perfumes
                        that are supposedly the same
                        tend to smell differently to EDPs.

                    base

                        They are composed of light and volatile notes, lasting the shortest time from 5 to 30 minutes.
